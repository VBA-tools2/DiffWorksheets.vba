This is a very simple Excel VBA class to quickly and easily compare the content of two different worksheets.

== Features

By intention (up to this point) there are not much features to keep it really simple.
Important is that only cell _content_ is compared. In detail it is checked for

. error values
. formulae (i.e. if both entered formulae are equal)
. content (i.e. numbers or (case-sensitive) text/strings)

in that particular order.

That means, stuff like

* cell formatting (font, color, number formatting, etc.)
* comments to cells

is _not_ compared/checked.

Optionally you can also compare if numbers are "`approximately equal`".
To do so please search for the function `+GetFormulaStringWithPrecisionChoice+` in the `+DiffWorksheetsDiff.cls+` class module (and its other occurrence).
Please have a look at the corresponding comments.

== Prerequisites / Dependencies

Since this is an Excel VBA class you obviously need Microsoft Excel.

In addition you need (the sources of)

* {uri-VbaTools2-cFormOnTop}.

[#how-to-install]
== How to install / Getting started

Add the file(s) from

* the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder and
* the link:{uri-VbaTools2-cFormOnTop}/src[cFormOnTop src] folder

to your project.
Yes, it's that simple.

._If you need some more advice on how to do that, expand me._
[%collapsible]
====
. Open Microsoft Excel.
. Open the Visual Basic Editor (VBE) (kbd:[Alt+F11]).
. Add the file(s) in the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder to your VBA project.
** With {uri-rubberduck}[Rubberduck]:
.. Right-click on the project to which you want to add the file(s) in the "`Code Explorer`" (to show it press kbd:[Ctrl+R]) and click on menu:Add[Existing Files...].
.. Select all files in the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder and click on btn:[Open].
** Without Rubberduck:
.. Select all files in the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder in Windows File Explorer.
.. Drag-and-drop them to the corresponding project in VBE's "`Project Explorer`". +
   (To show it press kbd:[Ctrl+R].
   Hit it twice if the Code Explorer shows up first.)
. Add the file(s) from the link:{uri-VbaTools2-cFormOnTop}/src[cFormOnTop src folder] as well to the project.
// BUG: "project name" can't be put in normal angle brackets, because the closing bracket would be interpreted as menu delimiter. I couldn't find a way how to "escape" that (i.e. a backslash didn't work). Thus, single guillemets are used.
. Check, if there are obvious errors by compiling the project (menu:Debug[Compile â€¹project nameâ€º]).
. Save the file/project.
.. Be sure that the file/project you want to save is "`active`" in the VBE by checking, if its name is shown in VBE's title bar. +
   (If it's not, open a (class) module of the corresponding project (and close it again).)
.. Press the "`Save`" button (the disc symbol similar to ðŸ’¾) in VBE's toolbar.
.. Check that the file (really) was saved by having a look at the "`last modified date`" of the (project) file in the Windows File Explorer.
====

For convenience you can add an icon to Quick Access Toolbar (QAT).
Here an example link on how to do this: +
{uri-ExcelRibbon-QAT}

== Usage / Show it in action

If you have added an icon to the QAT (see the last section) you simply need to press it.
A small form shows up where normally the active sheet is preselected as the first worksheet.
Activate the second worksheet the usual way and then press the btn:[Set second Worksheet].

If there is no reason to prevent the comparison (e.g. you selected the same worksheet twice) a new worksheet with the name `+diff+` will be added in front of the first selected worksheet.
All compared cells are marked with a gray background color.
If cell content is different, it shows that with the number 1.

To quickly count the number of different cells, select the "`used range`" by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+A] and have a look at the `+sum+` number in the statusbar (in the lower right corner of the Excel window).footnote:[
If the sum isn't shown you maybe have disabled it.
Right-click on the statusbar and click on the corresponding menu entry.]

== Running Tests

Unfortunately I don't know how to create automated tests/unit tests for this project.
If you have an idea, I would love to see it!
Please add an issue or â€“ even better â€“ a pull request (see the <<#contributing>> section).

== Used By

I don't think that this project can be of use inside of another project.
But I would love to be proven wrong ðŸ¥°.

== Known issues and limitations

Hmm, one could list a lot of stuff here.
As stated earlier, this is a _simple_ diff/comparison tool ...

== Contributing

All contributions are highly welcome!!

If you are new to git/GitHub, please have a look at {uri-GitHub-FirstContribution} where you will find a lot of useful information for beginners.

I recently was pointed to {uri-commit-messages} which sounds very promising.
I will use them from now on too (and hopefully don't forget it in a hurry).

== FAQ

[qanda]
What are the `+'@...+` comments good for in the code?::
You should really have a look at the awesome {uri-rubberduck}[Rubberduck] project!

== Similar Projects

None that we are aware of.

But if _you_ know some, please let me know.
Maybe we can combine forces.
